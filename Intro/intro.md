## When to use Azure IOT


1. Suppose you work in a large retail environment where IoT is deployed. The shelves have sensors monitoring the product for replenishment. The aisles in the store have cameras to monitor flow of people taking items off shelves. The combination of the sensors and cameras helps make the restocking of shelves quick and efficient. In this scenario, which part of the digital feedback loop can you identify?
   - Employees are given only the accurate information about items out of stock. So, operations are optimized because employee time is focused.
2. Consider the same retail scenario as in the previous question. The cameras are designed to spot overcrowding. Computer vision algorithms can spot a person with disabilities struggling in the aisles. Staff are notified and can help the customer. In this scenario, which part of the digital feedback loop can you identify?
   - Engage customers
   - Because the customer is provided with a personalized, responsive, and contextual experience.
3. Consider the scenario of monitoring the status of wind turbines. Wind turbines operate in remote areas and are costly and expensive to monitor. Sensors monitor the health of turbines. Based on historical data from wind directions, gearbox temperature, wind speed, and turbine blade angles, a predictive maintenance model is created in the cloud. The models are deployed to turbines and take real-time decisions based on operating conditions. This scenario is an example of:
   - Intelligent cloud and intelligent edge
   - Because the models are built in the cloud and deployed on the edge.

### summary 
Summary
- Letâ€™s consider the scenario of the logistics company for transporting fruit and other perishable. The multiple stakeholders involved (growers, retailers, transport operators, and customers) all want to ensure the quality of the produce in real time.

- In this scenario, Azure IoT can help in building a secure solution for all the stakeholders. The solution provisions, connects, monitors, and controls all your IoT assets end-to-end through the cloud. Without the Azure IoT solution provisioned through the cloud, the stakeholders wouldn't be able to ensure the quality of the produce in real time.

- The Azure IoT solution provides business value by keeping track of temperature, humidity etc. during the transportation process. The solution extends beyond telemetry by providing analytics and edge solutions to provide real-time status for the stakeholders.

- As a logistics company serving multiple stakeholders (growers, retailers, end customers), the deployment of IoT allows you to apply engineering principles to the entire process. IoT functions as a data capture mechanism (for example, individual sensors in trucks) which leads to understanding the end-to-end process. Once understood, the process can be modeled and improved by the deployment of analytics. Through the sensor data, we can understand the safety of the fruit (for example ensuring that the produce remains safe to consume).
